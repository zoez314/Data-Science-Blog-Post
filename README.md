# Data Science Blog Post: Loan Default Prediction Analysis

## Project Description

This project involves predicting whether a loan will be fully paid or defaulted based on various features such as loan type, income level, credit score, and others. The goal is to build machine learning models (Logistic Regression and Random Forest) to predict loan default status and to explore which factors have the most significant impact on loan outcomes.

The project is aimed at showcasing the process of data analysis, modeling, and business insights generation from a real-world dataset, and is communicated through a blog post to non-technical stakeholders.

## Libraries Used

- **pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **numpy**: Numerical operations
- **matplotlib**: Data visualization
- **seaborn**: Statistical data visualization
- **scikit-learn**: Machine learning algorithms and model evaluation
- **xgboost**: Gradient boosting model (optional, if used)
- **statsmodels**: Statistical analysis

## Motivation

The goal of this project is to help lenders assess the risk of loan defaults more effectively. By predicting whether a loan will default, banks and financial institutions can make better lending decisions, minimize losses, and optimize their operations.

This analysis is part of a blog post that explains the data science workflow in an easily understandable format for non-technical stakeholders.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/zoez314/Data-Science-Blog-Post.git
Install the required libraries: You can install the necessary libraries using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Or if using Anaconda:

bash
Copy code
conda install --file requirements.txt
Open the notebook: Launch Jupyter Notebook and open the file loan_default_prediction.ipynb to view and execute the analysis.

Usage
Load the dataset by running the first cell in the Jupyter notebook.
Follow the steps outlined in the notebook to perform:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, etc.)
Model building and evaluation (Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
Visualize the results of the model's performance.
You can modify the models or use your own dataset to test different loan default prediction scenarios.
Analysis Summary
The dataset contains several features related to loan information. Key business questions answered in this analysis include:

What are the most important features affecting loan defaults?
Can we predict if a loan will be paid in full or defaulted?
How can we improve the model's performance?
The models achieved the following performance metrics:

Logistic Regression Accuracy: 83.8%
Random Forest Accuracy: 83.5%
Key insights from the analysis:

The most important features for predicting loan defaults include credit score, income level, and loan type.
The models performed reasonably well, though there is room for improvement in terms of recall for classifying defaulted loans.
