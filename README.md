# Loan Repayment Analysis: README  

## Project Overview  
This project analyzes loan repayment behavior using a dataset of **9,578 loan records**. The goal is to uncover insights into factors affecting loan defaults and evaluate predictive models for better decision-making.  

---

## Key Questions Addressed  
1. **Which factors influence loan defaults the most?**  
2. **What role does the credit score (`fico`) play in repayment behavior?**  
3. **Do repayment probabilities vary across loan purposes?**  
4. **Which predictive model performs better: Logistic Regression or Random Forest?**
